1. To execute the code for this project submission, open up a Jupyter Notebook 
   with Python 3.
2. Copy the entire contents of a python file (e.g. Q1-Q3.py) into a single cell
   and execute that single cell.
3. Repeat this process for each python file. It is best to start from an empty
   Jupyter Notebook for each new python file. It should be sufficient to just
   delete any existing cells, and then copy and paste the entire contents of
   the next python file into an empty cell before executing.

If you run into any issues, it may be that you need to install certain packages
(scikit-learn, nltk, numpy, pandas, etc.) in your python environment before 
executing the code.
