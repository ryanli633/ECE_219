1. To execute the code for this project submission, open up a Jupyter Notebook 
   with Python 3 in the same directory as the files.
2. Run the files in order (type "%run filename.py" in a cell)
3. Repeat this process for each python file. The files can be run independently.

for Q16_final.py:
-lines 35, 37 & 38 are commented out. 
-change directory to your bbc data in lines 37 & 38 and uncomment
-run

If you run into any issues, it may be that you need to install certain packages
(scikit-learn, nltk, numpy, pandas, etc.) in your python environment before 
executing the code.
