1. To execute the code for this project submission, first update the filepaths
   for ratings.csv (and movies.csv) at the top of each python file to where you 
   have those data files in your directory.
   ratings_file_path = <PATH to ratings.csv>
   movies_file_path = <PATH to movies.csv>
2. Open up a Jupyter Notebook with Python 3 in the same directory as the files.
3. Run the files in order (type "%run filename.py" in a cell)
4. Repeat this process for each python file. The files can be run independently.

If you run into any issues, it may be that you need to install certain packages
(scikit-learn, nltk, numpy, pandas, etc.) in your python environment before 
executing the code.
