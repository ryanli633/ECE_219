1. To execute the code for this project submission, open up a Jupyter Notebook 
   with Python 3 in the same directory as the files.
2. In each python file, update the filepaths for ratings.csv and movies.csv 
   to where you have those data files in your directory.
3. Run the files in order (type "%run filename.py" in a cell)
4. Repeat this process for each python file. The files can be run independently.

If you run into any issues, it may be that you need to install certain packages
(scikit-learn, nltk, numpy, pandas, etc.) in your python environment before 
executing the code.
